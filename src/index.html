						If I had two nickels to rub together, I would rub them together Like a
						kid rubs sticks together Until friction made combustion And they
						burned a hole in my pocket Into which I would put my hand And then my
						arm And eventually my whole self. I would fold myself Into the hole in
						my pocket and disappear Into the pocket of myself, or at least my
						pants, But before I did Like some ancient star, Iâ€™d grab your hand.
